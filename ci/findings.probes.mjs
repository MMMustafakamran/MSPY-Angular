/**
 * Finding probes: one entry per open FINDINGS.md item that a package update
 * could fix on its own. Each probe compiles the verbatim doc code and proves
 * the defect is still there. When `expect` stops matching, the finding may
 * have been fixed upstream -- a human then re-checks and edits FINDINGS.md.
 *
 * Commands and evidence mirror autorecorder/actions/compile-casts.ts (the
 * compile-error clip), but use `ng build`, which exits, instead of `ng serve`.
 * Keep the two in step if a configuration or error text changes.
 *
 * Keys are FINDINGS.md numbers. 'a2ui-pending' is a PLACEHOLDER: the A2UI
 * finding is PENDING APPROVAL and not yet in FINDINGS.md. Once it is added,
 * rename the key and `id` to its number.
